As one journalist working along the border between Turkey and Syria put it recently, “Journalists in Syria are seen as walking bags of money.” Unsurprisingly, most journalists and foreign aid workers are now avoiding Syria entirely — raising fears that the extremists would begin taking hostages elsewhere.
