“From Day 1 of Jordan joining the coalition against ISIS, part of our people believed it’s not our war,” said Oraib al-Rantawi, director of the Al-Quds Center for Political Studies here. “Another part felt that sooner or later it will be, so it’s better to fight them in the backyard of another country than in our own bedrooms.”

“Moaz is in every bedroom in Jordan now,” said Naif al-Amoun, a member of Jordan’s Parliament who is from Lieutenant Kasasbeh’s hometown, Karak. “We are not going to let anyone exploit this issue to turn us against the government.”

Mr. Amoun added, “In the last couple of days, the treatment of the pilot backfired against ISIS. Instead of dividing Jordan, Jordanians are more united behind their government.”
